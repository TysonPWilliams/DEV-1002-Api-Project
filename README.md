# Freelancer Job Board API

## Overview

The **Freelancer Job Board API** is structured using a relational database model optimized to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**. The API ensures **data integrity, avoids redundancy**, and maintains clear relationships between **freelancers, clients, jobs, applications, contracts, and reviews**.

## Features

- **User Management**: Freelancers and clients can register and manage their profiles.
- **Job Listings**: Clients can post jobs, and freelancers can browse available job opportunities.
- **Job Applications**: Freelancers can submit applications with bid amounts.
- **Contract System**: A formal agreement is created between a client and a freelancer upon job acceptance.
- **Review System**: After contract completion, both parties can leave reviews and ratings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. PostgreSQL Setup

- Download and install **PostgreSQL** from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- Open **PostgreSQL** in your linux environment by running:

```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```

- Create a new database and user

```sql
create database job_board_db;
create user job_board_dev with password 'secure_password';
```

- Grant ownership of the database to the new user and give all permissions
```sql
alter database job_board_db owner to job_board_dev;
grant all privileges on database job_board_db to job_board_dev;
grant all privileges on schema public to job_board_dev;
```

- Exit **PostgreSQL**
```shell
CTRL + Z
```
### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # MacOS/Linux
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your database connection string using your username, password, and database name. The host and port should be 127.0.0.1:8088

```ini
DB_URI = 'postgresql+psycopg2://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db name>'
```

### 5. Initialise the Database

```sh
flask db init
flask db seed  
```

### 6. Run the Flask Application

```sh
flask run
```

- The API should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8088/`
