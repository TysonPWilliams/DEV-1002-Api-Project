## âœ… Summary & Reflection
**Key Takeaways:** 
- Security concerns were a recuring theme in feedback
- Organisational improvements were highlighted, such as structuring documentation better
- Not all feedback requests received responses, which might indicate a need for better follow-up
- Some feedback was evident that the ERD wasn't looked at properly as a join table for users and skills was suggested although there was no tables titled Skills

**Improvements Implemented:**
- Removed the Payments table due to security risks
- Created a Docs folder to better organise documentation
- Initially implemented IP storage for fraud prevention but later reversed due to security concerns

**Future Considerations:** 
- Follow up with unresponsive recipients to ensure critital feedback isn't missed
- Develop a structured review process for ERD feedback, including multiple security checks
- Establish a best practice guide for documentation structure to maintain consistency across projects
